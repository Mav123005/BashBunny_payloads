Description:
	Script for changing what happens when a target copies any thing over 33 characters in length. It is set up in a way it will change it to your btc address or with some tinkering literally delate two things email if you wish so if you no a email of a target it will change it to yours so for example if your targets boss's email was email@email.com you would change it to implement it after 15 characters to do that open python_script.txt and follow instructions. I only wrote the Ducky script for this so I would like to give my thanks to @kevthehermit for the ducky payload template and the John G. Fisher YouTube channel
